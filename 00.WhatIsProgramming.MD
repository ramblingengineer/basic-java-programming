## What is Programming?

Instruction(s) to process data that computer will execute to solve a problem.
Programming consist of Algorithm and Data Structure.

### Data Structure

How we/computer read and write the data.

#### Analogy of Data Structure: Cooking Recipe Ingredients
```
List of Ingredients:
- 2.5 cups of Plain Flour
- 2 teaspoons of Sugar
```
Above data contains:
- Measurement in Decimal → 2.5, 2
- Unit of Measurement in Text → cups, teaspoons
- Name of Ingredients in Text → Plain Flour, Sugar
And it is stored in a "List" data structure.

### Algorithm

The instructions for the computer to process the data and solve a problem.

#### Analogy of Algorithm: Cooking Recipe Instructions
```
Peel and core the apples; slice 1/4 inch thick.
Transfer to a bowl and toss with the sugar and lemon juice.
```
Above instructions contains:
- Instruction to process the data → Apple
  - Peel 
  - Core
  - Slice 1/4 inch
- Instruction to process the apple that has been peel, cored and sliced
  - Transfer to a bowl
  - Put data into → it Sugar and Lemon Juice
